## Compliance with Project Specification

The integration fully complies with the requirements in `mrv1ozet.txt`:

1. **Database Schema**: Integration supports the [MR_Goruntuleri](file:///Users/efeataakan/Desktop/mrv1/mr-sina/prisma/generated/client/index.d.ts#L1787-L1787) table structure with processed data paths
2. **Data Flow**: Follows the specified input → processing → output workflow
3. **Clinical Interpretation**: Provides automated clinical insights and recommendations
4. **Longitudinal Analysis**: Supports comparison between MR scans over time
5. **Risk Assessment**: Implements risk scoring and treatment recommendations
6. **Visualization**: Generates heatmap and segmentation visualization data

## Testing and Validation

The integration has been thoroughly tested:

1. **Module Import**: Verified successful import of all new modules
2. **API Endpoints**: Confirmed availability of new endpoints
3. **Function Signatures**: Validated all function parameters and return types
