# MONAI Import Error Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The "Import 'monai.inferers' could not be resolved" error was occurring because the MONAI library was not installed in the Python virtual environment being used by the project.

### Specific Issues:
1. **Missing MONAI Installation**: The virtual environment at `../mr_env` did not have the MONAI library installed
2. **Incorrect Pyright Configuration**: The `pyrightconfig.json` was pointing to a non-existent or incorrect virtual environment path
3. **Dependency Conflicts**: There were version conflicts between torch and torchvision packages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Installed MONAI in the Virtual Environment
```bash
/Users/efeataakan/Desktop/mrv1/mr_env/bin/python -m pip install monai
```

This command installed:
- MONAI 1.5.0
- Updated torch to 2.6.0 (required by MONAI)
- Downgraded sympy to 1.13.1 (required by torch)

### 2. Resolved Dependency Conflicts
Installed a compatible version of torchvision:
```bash
/Users/efeataakan/Desktop/mrv1/mr_env/bin/python -m pip install torchvision==0.21.0
```

### 3. Updated Pyright Configuration
Modified `pyrightconfig.json` to correctly reference the virtual environment:
- Updated `venvPath` to `"../../mr_env"`
- Updated `venv` to `"mr_env"`
- Updated `extraPaths` to include the correct site-packages path

## Verification

Created and ran a test script that verified all MONAI imports used in the project:
- `monai.inferers.SlidingWindowInferer` ✅
- `monai.networks.nets.UNet` ✅
- `monai.transforms` components ✅
- `monai.data.Dataset` and `DataLoader` ✅
- `monai.handlers` components ✅
- `monai.apps.download_url` ✅

All imports are now working correctly, and the "Import 'monai.inferers' could not be resolved" error has been resolved.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always ensure dependencies are installed in the correct virtual environment
2. Keep the pyright configuration updated to point to the correct environment
3. Regularly test imports to catch issues early
4. Document the correct setup process for new developers
